# Card-pile-transformations

This java application transforms piles of cards from 1 to n and a given row length in a particular order, either picking
up by rows or columns starting at one of the four corners (As if the cards were laid out as a 2D array). It also calculates
the number of counts in order to revert back to the original pile state.

This java application was created and designed to replicate how a user-friendly and client orientated programe runs.
