# Card-pile-transformations

This java application transformations piles of card from 1 to n and a given row length in a particular order, either picking
up by rows or columns from the four corners. It also calculates the number of counts in order to revert back to the original
pile state.

This java application was created and designed to replicate how a user-friendly and client orientated programe runs.
